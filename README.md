# recipe-chrome-extention

## Description:
It is a chrome extention that skips the back story of a recipes inception. (I.e.) this recipe comes from five generations ago... As well as this it adds a back to top button so as to not disturb the user if they want to read the backstory :).

I made it because I personally want to read multiple recipies so I can figure out how I want to a recipe. I am sharing this so I can hope it can be of value to others. There is much room for extention as it works on only several websites (e.g. woks of life).
 
There is more room for extention for it to work on multiple websites, but every websites div's are different so it is difficult to have it working for all websites.

## Requirements:
Chrome browser
